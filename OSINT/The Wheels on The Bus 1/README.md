# SOLUTION

Note: Visiting the location in the video is out of the scope of this challenge.
In the video provided, we see that Lewis is at a bus stop next to an above-ground MRT station, and he boards bus number 48. This bus 48 is bound for Buona Vista Terminal. When checking this bus's bus route, we see that the bus stops at a number of MRT stations. However, most of these stations are underground stations such as Botanic Gardens MRT and Bugis MRT. Thus, the only possible bus stop for this challenge is Tanah Merah stn exit A, which bus stop code is 85099.
