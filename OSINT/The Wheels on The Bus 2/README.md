Note: Visiting the location in the video is out of the scope of this challenge.

# SOLUTION

From the video, we see that Lewis has alighted at Empress market, and walks from the overhead bridge into the HDB estate behind Empress Market. By using Google Earth, we were able to pin point his location as he walked further, narrowing down his final location to Block 8 Empress Road, which postal code is 260008.
