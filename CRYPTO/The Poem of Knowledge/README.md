# SOLUTION

Challenge description gives away that it is Beale cipher
Using https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/book-cipher and setting Part 1 to Word and Part 2 to None and replacing - with space gives 
`IHad one perhaps equally Yet one undergrowth; having as diverged agrassy roads ever as the took it morning equally *`
Taking the first letter of each word and wrapping with flag format gives `WH2022{IHopeYouhadagreattime}`
