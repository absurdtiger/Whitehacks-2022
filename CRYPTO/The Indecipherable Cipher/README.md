# The Indecipherable Cipher

`CP2022{j1b3n3e3_15_Pcn_Xa3f@x_K1dC3R_0A_yB3F01Ys}` looks like a Rotation Cipher but rotating C to W gives `WJ2022{d1v3h3y3_15_Jwh_Ru3z@r_E1xW3L_0U_sV3Z01Sm}`
Challenge description says key is the true inventor of the cipher
Trying Vignere using key `Giovan` which can be obtained from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher gives `WH2022{v1g3n3r3_15_Juz_Ca3s@r_C1pH3R_0N_sT3R01Ds}`
