Planet X0507-LJL has decided to run the inaugural galactic exchange program with the students from their planet with our Earth. While gathering images of the different universities on Earth, Planet X0507-LJL discovered an image containing hidden information amongst the images of the different universities. The information seems to be hidden in the bits.

Help them crack this image and figure out the hidden transmission!

we did not manage to solve this. Allegedly the solution is to base64 gunzip [image](./SMU_hidden.png). However, I found that base64 on the png doesn't automatically make it a .gz, so I'm confused, and you can also see my attempts in this directory messing with the file headers.
