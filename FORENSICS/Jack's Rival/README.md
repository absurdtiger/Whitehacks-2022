We know the infamous murderer Jack the Ripper from the 1880s, but are you aware that Jack had a twin brother, John, who also turned out to be his fiercest rival as they compete for fame?

John was last seen competing to see who could outsing Freddie Mercury in a soprano contest out in the public before he went hiding. He left a file containing a note about his darkest secret. Are you able to retrieve it?
