Thank goodness you got the passwords before the alien invaders! But it seems the aliens have shifted their sights and are looking up the shimmy dance... If they get to see the dance, they would have the key to defeat humankind!

We need you to quickly identify how much they have seen, we have the following piece of intel: An application was executed at: "2022-02-26 18:43:31 UTC+0000"

Find the application, and we will be able to handle the rest!

Flag is in the format: WH2022{absolute_path_of_executed_application}

Note: Reuse the same file (memdump.mem) from "The Prompt Within"
